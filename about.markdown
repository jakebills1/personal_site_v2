Hi, I'm Jake! I am a Full Stack Software Engineer at [Direct](https://www.getdirect.io/), a property management system for the vacation rental industry. 

## My Background

My story as a developer starts with going to college for music, strangely enough. I was taking a music techonology course, where one of the units involved programming with SuperCollider, a code-based music synthesis application. This sparked an interest in technology and programming, leading me to install Linux on my computer, try (and fail) to use the command line for everything, and learn some fundamentals through online resources such as Harvard's CS50. I ended up graduating with my Bachelors of Music from the University of Utah in 2015 and spent years working as a freelance musician. My career in music involved traveling to 9 states in the Western US to perform, playing a wedding that featured a stampede of white horses, and teaching students ages 7-50+. 

However, I grew sick of the uncertainty of full-time freelancing and decided to take my interest in programming to the next level by enrolling in [DevPoint Labs]() full time web development bootcamp. I spent over 40 hours a week for three months learning how to write and deploy complex web applications using a Ruby on Rails/React/Postgresql tech stack. This was my first experience collaborating with others, writing software people would actually use, and taking feedback from clients. I spent the summer after graduating from DevPoint working on a personal site, writing a site for my [father's business](), and studying a wide variety of topics within tech. 

## My Experience

My first job was an internship in software development in the Assessors Office at Salt Lake County. My main duties there were user-testing and writing documentation for a property tax assessment system being devloped by the State of Utah, as well as working with the rest of the intern team to write an in-house tool for the Assessors Office to use in their yearly audit process. I gained exposure to some new technologies during this experience such as C#, Angular, Ext JS, and SQL Server. 

A few highlights from my internship: 
- Writing a .NET API along with the other interns using Entity Framework and the repository pattern
- Writing the entire test suite for that API 
- Writing a prototype test suite in Postman to integrate into an Azure Devops pipeline

During my internship, I interviewed and was hired for my first full time role at Direct, as a Full Stack Software Engineer. I have been working there since February 2020. My daily tasks involve writing reuseable React components, writing performant Rails services, doing code review and QA for my coworkers' features, and working with our Product and Operations teams to design solutions for our clients' pressing business needs. Some of the challenges I have faced at Direct have involved addressing tech debt to scale the platform for large-scale property management companies, writing features with a user experience fitting our founders vision of the company, and prioritizing multiple high priorities while balancing velocity and high code standards. 

Some of my accomplishments so far at Direct have been: 
- In reaction to our clients seeing a large number of charge backs during the initial Covid-19 lockdown, I wrote a system to produce a standard contract for every booking through our system. One of our largest clients said that his team's time spent fighting chargebacks was "cut in half" by this feature.
- As part of our effort to scale our platform and deal with performance issues, I made some changes to our Puma configuration which resulted in a drop in mean response time by ~60% and a 50% increase in throughput. Our incidence of timeout errors in Heroku also dropped dramatically.  

I am really enjoying working at Direct and am looking forward to expanding my experience in the overall architectural and software design categories.
